# Laura & Giorgio

Simple website for our wedding to share information with our guests and manage RSVP.

## TODO

### a.k.a. I wish I had more time to do them all but I will realistically only do some of them

- better design
- more reusable components
- standardised naming/styling convention
- multi language (guests speak italian, german and/or english)
- set up headless CMS to manage content
- authentication to manage guest list
- set up a newsletter
- set up a payment gateway to manage wedding contribution
- ... TBC
